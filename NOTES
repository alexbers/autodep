This is few notes mainly for myself.

1. Format of log record:
 <time of event: sec since 1970>
 <event type: stat, create, open, read, write>
 <name of file>
 <building stage: stagename or unknown>
 <result:OK,ERR/errno,ASKING,DENIED>

2. Format of answer for ASKING packet:
 <ALLOW | DENY>

3. Format of events structure:
 [
  {
   <stage of building>:{<filename>:(<was readed>,<was writed>)}
  },
  {
   <stage of building>:{<filename>:(<was not found>,<was blocked>)}
  }
 ]

4. Format of converted events structure:
 {
#  packagesinfo: {
   <package|unknown>: {
    stage: {
     <filename>:
      {found:[<was readed>,<was writed>],
       notfound:[<was not found>,<was blocked>]}
    }
   }
  }
  
  #otherfilesinfo: {
  # stage:{
  #  <filename>:
	# {found:[<was readed>,<was writed>],
	# notfound:[<was not found>,<was blocked>]}
   #}
  #}
 }
